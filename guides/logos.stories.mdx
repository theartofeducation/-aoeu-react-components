# Brand and Product Logos

All organizational brand and product logos are available for consumption from
this resource.

## Brand Logos

Depending on your use case, our brand and product logos can be consumed by dependent projects in a couple of different ways. The logo images are available as standalone SVG image files, or, we also have [a logo component available](/?path=/story/components-logo--brand-logo) as well (`@aoeu/logos`), which provides some flexible options for rendering the logo images.

For [React](https://reactjs.org) projects we recommend using the components. When using a component is practical or just not necessary, you can also use just the standalone SVG images of the logos with the `@aoeu/logo-svgs` package.

### Using the standalone SVGs package

```shell
yarn add @aoeu/logo-svgs
```

After you've added the `@aoeu/logo-svgs` package as a dependency to your project, you can then import and use the logos like this:

```js
import AOEULogo from "@aoeu/logo-svgs/aoeu-logo-horizontal.svg"
```

This can then be used as the source for an image tag in the following manner:

```jsx
<img src={AOEULogo} alt="The Art of Education University Logo - horizontal" />
```

Here is a list of the available SVG logo images available in the package:

* `aoeu-logo-horizontal.svg`
* `aoeu-logo-mark.svg`
* `aoeu-logo-vertical.svg`
* `conference-product-logo.svg`
* `flex-pro-product-bundle-logo.svg`
* `flex-product-logo.svg`
* `graduate-course-product-logo.svg`
* `magazine-product-logo.svg`
* `masters-product-logo.svg`
* `pro-product-logo.svg`

### Using the logo components package

```shell
yarn add @aoeu/logos
```

After you've added the `@aoeu/logos` package as a dependency to your project, you can then import and use the logo components like this:

```js
import { AOEULogo } from "@aoeu/logos"
```

See [the logo component stories](/?path=/story/components-brand-and-product-logos--brand-logo) for more details on the available component options.
