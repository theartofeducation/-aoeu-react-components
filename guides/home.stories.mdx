# AOEU Web/UI Style Guide

This style guide provides documentation and usage details for a collection of reusable components and packages collectively referred to as `ui-common`. These components and packages are built and available for use in building web application projects at [The Art of Education University](https://theartofeducation.github.io).

Here you will find documentation for common UI resources like our [Color Palette](/?path=/story/guides-colors--page) and [Typography Resources](/?path=/story/guides-typography--page) via [the Sass package](/?path=/story/packages-sass--page), [Brand and Product Logos](/?path=/story/guides-logos--page) and [Reusable Component](/?path=/story/components-components-overview--page) library, as well as our [common JS utilities package](/?path=/story/packages-utils--page).

If you see something here that you feel to be incorrect, inaccurate or out-dated, please feel free to [create an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/theartofeducation/ui-common/issues) in which this documentation lives._
